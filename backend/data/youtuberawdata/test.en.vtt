00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.421
If you're boarding a big aircraft, the
kind of large Boeing or Airbus that

00:00:03.421 --> 00:00:07.300
goes across the Atlantic, you'll probably
get on and off the plane using a jetbridge.

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:11.280
That's the movable, extendable corridor
that connects the terminal to the plane.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.692
But sometimes, the plane will have to park at
what's called a "remote stand",

00:00:15.692 --> 00:00:18.650
just a spot that's assigned
in the middle of the tarmac.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.292
And so, as the rain piles down, some
cold and tired airport staff

00:00:22.292 --> 00:00:24.480
will roll a set of stairs up,
and you end up

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.000
riding a slow and crowded
airport bus instead.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.915
I guess you do get to skip the long walk
through the terminal, and it's great if

00:00:29.915 --> 00:00:33.670
you're the sort of aviation geek who likes
looking behind the scenes at an airport...

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.960
but it's not ideal if you
have a connection to make.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.390
It could have been very different.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.381
The last time I flew into Montreal, here in
Canada, the aircraft door opened and

00:00:43.381 --> 00:00:47.970
on the other side was what looked like
a strange bus on stilts.

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:48.680
There were three of them.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.620
Passenger transport vehicles, PTVs, one
connected to each door of the plane.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.030
And I figured I had a new video idea.

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.420
- We have eight PTVs that are in use
right now at Montreal Trudeau Airport.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.718
Of course, we always strive to
do gating directly,

00:01:06.718 --> 00:01:10.144
but during summer season or some peak season during winter time,

00:01:10.144 --> 00:01:12.948
we have no choice but
to use remote parking.

00:01:12.948 --> 00:01:15.918
During our peak season
on a regular day,

00:01:15.918 --> 00:01:19.370
we receive a bit more than 500 flights
here at Montreal Trudeau.

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:25.680
And of those 500 flights, about 10 to 15
of them will be remotely gated with a PTV.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.416
- The idea came from
legendary architect Eero Saarinen,

00:01:28.416 --> 00:01:30.378
as part of his plan for
Washington Dulles Airport,

00:01:30.378 --> 00:01:32.340
which still also uses them.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.650
The original name was "mobile lounge".

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.150
They were promoted in a short film
produced by his friends,

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.050
equally legendary designers
Charles and Ray Eames.

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:45.689
And that film shows exactly the sort
of late-50s luxury techno-optimism that

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.640
wouldn't survive the next few decades.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.999
Saarinen's original plan was that airport
terminals would work much like they do now,

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:55.040
but smaller, with boarding doors
close together.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.173
When it was time to board, a mobile lounge
would dock to the terminal,

00:01:58.173 --> 00:01:59.545
everyone would get on board,

00:01:59.545 --> 00:02:02.470
and they'd be taken out to the
remote stand in comfort.

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.649
Less space needed, less walking, less noise
near the terminal, easier for everyone.

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:09.340
And it worked.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.230
There are photos of mobile lounges
lined up outside

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.450
brand new shiny terminals
that were designed for them.

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.340
- When passengers see them arriving, they know
that they're not going to have to go outside

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.310
in the rain and the snow with their luggage.

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.280
For people with reduced mobility,
it's more efficient.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.960
For parents, and all the stuff that goes
with traveling with children, it's easier.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.995
A PTV can welcome between 100 and 120
passengers per trip,

00:02:33.995 --> 00:02:39.750
while a regular bus is more in
the mid 70s, 75 passengers.

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.920
- Montreal's PTVs here are a more
modern variant called the Plane-Mate.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.650
The original lounges were smaller than
this, and instead of lifting up on stilts,

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.425
they extended a boarding ramp
that went out at an incline,

00:02:50.425 --> 00:02:53.600
because the planes they were
connecting to were smaller too.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.480
Back then, a fully loaded jet
might have 100 passengers.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.680
The largest modern planes
have four or five times that.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.030
Airport terminals were getting bigger
not just to accommodate planes,

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.580
but also sheer numbers of people.

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.598
Now, these newer versions are bigger,
and to dock with the plane,

00:03:08.598 --> 00:03:11.210
they lift themselves up
with a "screw drive".

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:12.760
Those big lumps on the top?

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.070
They're to cover up the poles that the
entire cabin is lifting itself along.

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:21.830
- We do the maintenance
and operations of the PTVs.

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.210
We acquired the manufacturing rights
in the year 2000,

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:27.970
so we have all the engineering drawings
and everything.

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:33.240
I would say now, we got it down to
probably less than 20% that is custom.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.400
The rest is off the shelf parts that we can get.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:42.730
We have built new ones, and right now we are
looking at retrofitting them to electrical.

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.180
Our mechanics every day do a walk-around.

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.790
We guarantee 99.8% efficiency to the airport.

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.910
- So why didn't these end up
being used around the world?

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.160
Eero Saarinen blamed the cost,
and that was certainly a factor.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.920
Planes getting bigger was another.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.040
And the former head of the Washington
Airports Authority said that passengers

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.880
don't like them because we want autonomy.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.870
We want to get off the damn plane and
walk for a bit under our own power.

00:04:11.954 --> 00:04:15.132
But if you ask me, I think the main
reason is that in 1958,

00:04:15.132 --> 00:04:17.451
the same year that
animated film was made,

00:04:17.451 --> 00:04:20.250
the first modern jet bridge
was also installed.

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.170
There was one victory for that
luxury techno-optimism, though.

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:28.260
The end of that film shows mobile lounges
at a surely-soon-to-arrive spaceport.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.654
And while, sadly, no one's boarding a Pan Am
flight to the Moon any time soon,

00:04:31.654 --> 00:04:36.280
NASA did buy a couple of Plane-Mates
for astronaut transport.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.140
There's nothing wrong with mobile lounges.

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.390
They still work well here in Montreal.

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:43.891
But when airports were expanding and had to
choose,

00:04:43.891 --> 00:04:48.075
most of them decided that jetbridges
were just a little bit easier and cheaper.

00:04:50.225 --> 00:04:51.790
I'm not allowed to drive this, by the way.

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:55.205
Like, thank you to everyone from Montreal
Airport for letting me sit here, and for

00:04:55.205 --> 00:04:57.220
all the access they've given me, but...

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:58.204
I'm not allowed to drive this.
