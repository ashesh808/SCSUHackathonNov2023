If you're boarding a big aircraft, the
kind of large Boeing or Airbus that goes across the Atlantic, you'll probably
get on and off the plane using a jetbridge. That's the movable, extendable corridor
that connects the terminal to the plane. But sometimes, the plane will have to park at
what's called a "remote stand", just a spot that's assigned
in the middle of the tarmac. And so, as the rain piles down, some
cold and tired airport staff will roll a set of stairs up,
and you end up riding a slow and crowded
airport bus instead. I guess you do get to skip the long walk
through the terminal, and it's great if you're the sort of aviation geek who likes
looking behind the scenes at an airport... but it's not ideal if you
have a connection to make. It could have been very different. The last time I flew into Montreal, here in
Canada, the aircraft door opened and on the other side was what looked like
a strange bus on stilts. There were three of them. Passenger transport vehicles, PTVs, one
connected to each door of the plane. And I figured I had a new video idea. - We have eight PTVs that are in use
right now at Montreal Trudeau Airport. Of course, we always strive to
do gating directly, but during summer season or some peak season during winter time, we have no choice but
to use remote parking. During our peak season
on a regular day, we receive a bit more than 500 flights
here at Montreal Trudeau. And of those 500 flights, about 10 to 15
of them will be remotely gated with a PTV. - The idea came from
legendary architect Eero Saarinen, as part of his plan for
Washington Dulles Airport, which still also uses them. The original name was "mobile lounge". They were promoted in a short film
produced by his friends, equally legendary designers
Charles and Ray Eames. And that film shows exactly the sort
of late-50s luxury techno-optimism that wouldn't survive the next few decades. Saarinen's original plan was that airport
terminals would work much like they do now, but smaller, with boarding doors
close together. When it was time to board, a mobile lounge
would dock to the terminal, everyone would get on board, and they'd be taken out to the
remote stand in comfort. Less space needed, less walking, less noise
near the terminal, easier for everyone. And it worked. There are photos of mobile lounges
lined up outside brand new shiny terminals
that were designed for them. - When passengers see them arriving, they know
that they're not going to have to go outside in the rain and the snow with their luggage. For people with reduced mobility,
it's more efficient. For parents, and all the stuff that goes
with traveling with children, it's easier. A PTV can welcome between 100 and 120
passengers per trip, while a regular bus is more in
the mid 70s, 75 passengers. - Montreal's PTVs here are a more
modern variant called the Plane-Mate. The original lounges were smaller than
this, and instead of lifting up on stilts, they extended a boarding ramp
that went out at an incline, because the planes they were
connecting to were smaller too. Back then, a fully loaded jet
might have 100 passengers. The largest modern planes
have four or five times that. Airport terminals were getting bigger
not just to accommodate planes, but also sheer numbers of people. Now, these newer versions are bigger,
and to dock with the plane, they lift themselves up
with a "screw drive". Those big lumps on the top? They're to cover up the poles that the
entire cabin is lifting itself along. - We do the maintenance
and operations of the PTVs. We acquired the manufacturing rights
in the year 2000, so we have all the engineering drawings
and everything. I would say now, we got it down to
probably less than 20% that is custom. The rest is off the shelf parts that we can get. We have built new ones, and right now we are
looking at retrofitting them to electrical. Our mechanics every day do a walk-around. We guarantee 99.8% efficiency to the airport. - So why didn't these end up
being used around the world? Eero Saarinen blamed the cost,
and that was certainly a factor. Planes getting bigger was another. And the former head of the Washington
Airports Authority said that passengers don't like them because we want autonomy. We want to get off the damn plane and
walk for a bit under our own power. But if you ask me, I think the main
reason is that in 1958, the same year that
animated film was made, the first modern jet bridge
was also installed. There was one victory for that
luxury techno-optimism, though. The end of that film shows mobile lounges
at a surely-soon-to-arrive spaceport. And while, sadly, no one's boarding a Pan Am
flight to the Moon any time soon, NASA did buy a couple of Plane-Mates
for astronaut transport. There's nothing wrong with mobile lounges. They still work well here in Montreal. But when airports were expanding and had to
choose, most of them decided that jetbridges
were just a little bit easier and cheaper. I'm not allowed to drive this, by the way. Like, thank you to everyone from Montreal
Airport for letting me sit here, and for all the access they've given me, but... I'm not allowed to drive this.
